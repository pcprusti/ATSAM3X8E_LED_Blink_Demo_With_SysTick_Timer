# ATSAM3X8E_LED_Blink_Demo_With_SysTick_Timer
This demo showcases how to use the SysTick timer—a built-in feature of ARM Cortex-M3 cores—to generate precise timing for blinking an LED. Instead of relying on software delay loops, the SysTick timer provides accurate millisecond-level interrupts, allowing the LED to toggle at consistent intervals without blocking the CPU.
